# Project 2 Prototype

This is a prototype of my second project. My project will be based on a Christmas-themed game. My 
second project will include multiple mini games, and will begin in a Christams-themed room. The player 
can then click on various objects within the room. Clicking on abjects will activate a separate mini-game. In the case of my mini-game, the user will have to decorate a Christmas tree as quickly 
as possible.
