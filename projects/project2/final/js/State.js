// State
// The following code uses a code example provided 
// by Pippin Parr : https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/main/examples/structure/oop-states-inheritance
// A class that defines the basic methods of a generic State for our
// program. If we wanted behaviour that *all* states share, we could
// put that code in here.
