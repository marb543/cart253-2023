## Project overview :

 This is a Christmas-themed game for my second project. The player has the task of helping Santa prepare everything for Christmas
 since Santa's gnomes rebelled against him. There are three mini-games included in my game. The first game is the players having 
 to decorate a Christmas tree before the timer runs out, and the second mini-game is the player having to catch Christmas presents in the 
 sleigh and avoid catching Christmas decorations. For the second mini-game, the player must have a positive number of points in order to 
 win the game. If the player loses one of the mini-games, he has lost the game. If the player is able to successfully complete all mini-games,
 he wins the game. 

 In the first mini-game, the player has to decorate a Christmas tree within 10 seconds of starting the game. In fact, the player 
 must add a Christmas tree star, Christmas tree decorations, and presents in order to win this mini-game, and continue playing the next mini-game.

 In the second mini-game, the player has to catch at least 5 presents in Santa's sleigh in order to win the mini-game. The player must 
 use the LEFT and RIGHT arrows of their keyboard in order to move Santa's sleigh horizontally, and catch presents. The player earns 1 point per
 pounce of the Christmas present on Santa's sleigh. The player can also lose 1 point per every bounce of the Christmas toy on Santa's sleigh. The game 
 ends when there are no more Christmas toys or presents on the screen. If the player has scored 5 or more points, he wins the game, otherwise, he loses the game.

## Artist's statement :
In composing my second project for this course, I conceived a Christmas-themed game centered around the captivating narrative of Santa's gnomes staging a rebellion, prompting the player's heroic mission to save Christmas. The objective of my game involves successfully completing a series of mini-games, each representing critical tasks that the mischievous gnomes have neglected.

To immerse players in the enchanting world of my game, I designed an "Introduction" state to tell the player the main game storyline. The artistic vision for my project is to evoke a magical Christmas atmosphere, instilling a sense of being present at the North Pole and actively assisting Santa Klaus. The desiredFor the desired user experience of my game , I want to create a festive atmosphere, seamlessly blending holiday-themed music and imagery.

Technically, I employed Adobe Photoshop to craft three distinct cover imagesâ€”Title, Game Over, and Game Won. Each one of my covers is designed to align with the thematic elements of my game. The interactive components of my game revolve around engaging Christmas activities, such as adorning a Christmas tree and collecting presents in Santa's sleigh. By intertwining narrative depth, visual aesthetics, and interactive elements, I endeavored to transport players into a joyous Christmas realm.
